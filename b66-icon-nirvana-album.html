                            <p>На этот раз для составления подборки редакторский коллектив Зайцев.нет несколько раз посетил местный спортзал. Overview. Icon is the band's second greatest hits collection. The album was released as part of the Icon series launched by Universal Music Enterprises, which featured greatest hits releases "from 30 major artists spanning rock, pop, RB and country.". After signing to major label DGC Records, Nirvana found unexpected success with "Smells Like Teen Spirit", the band's lead single from its second album Nevermind (1991). Subsequently, Nirvana entered into the mainstream, bringing along with it a subgenre of alternative rock called grunge. Jeff Buckley recorded one album in his life and is regarded by most as a genius but what if he had fucked up the re-recording of his second album and released a reggae album about his cat?

Yeah you heard me right.Not "Nevermind",not "İn Utero" and not even "Superunknown" but this classic album of Alice in Chains.And yes I have quite a few reasons why I think so.First of all I think "Dirt" is most "grungiest" of all grunge albums.What I mean by that? What I mean is it is the most loyal to its roots grunge album.Even for grunge it is too dirty,too nihilistic and well,too punk.İt retains what made grunge soo good but adds even more punkish quality to it.İn a way you could argue

When I was a wee baby, Nirvana released their seminal album Nevermind, and Smells Like Teen Spirit entered my world forever. Grunge exploded, and I never experienced a time where grunge wasn't a thing. I heard Smells Like Teen Spirit probably nearly every day just by existing in the world. I honestly didn't care much for it, but teens at the time were consciously experiencing a complete change in music, culture, media, fashion\-\-everything changed around them due to Nirvana, and culture icons.
